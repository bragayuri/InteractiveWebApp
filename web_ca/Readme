Dishes and its allergen content was idealized thinking about my background in nutrition 
summed with the skills I retrieved over this semester with this module.
When developing this project, the main idea was focused on creating a simple 
idea which could be deliverable using all the technologies we have been learning in class.

How to use it.
Table and its Allergen follows the Food Standard Agency UK and it is displayed as soon
Index.html is open.
Below the table User must write Dish`s name and write an X for each allergen ingredient
a dish shall contain.
Add Dish Button-> After text fields are filled click to add element to the table.
Delete Dish Button->After text fields are filled click to delete element to the table.

On the development process, all the code provided in class was efficiently used.

Code can be accessed on the gitHub below.
